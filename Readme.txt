Flower Classification with PyTorch
Overview
This repository contains code for building an image classification system using PyTorch and pre-trained ResNet-18 model. The model is trained to classify images of flowers into two classes: daisy and dandelion. The training process involves data augmentation, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use. Additionally, the README provides instructions for using the trained model to classify unseen images.

Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-classification.git
cd flower-classification
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
Organize your dataset:

Place your training and validation images in the dataset/train and dataset/val directories respectively.
Each class should have its own subdirectory within train and val.
Ensure your dataset follows the required structure:
kotlin
Copy code
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class1/
│   └── class2/
├── val/
│   ├── class1/
│   └── class2/
Usage
Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
After training, the model will be saved as flower_classification_model.pth.

To classify unseen images using the trained model, follow these steps:

Prepare your image for classification and ensure it follows the same transformations used during training.
Update the image_path variable in the classify_unseen_image.py script with the path to your image.
Run the classification script:
bash
Copy code
python classify_unseen_image.py
